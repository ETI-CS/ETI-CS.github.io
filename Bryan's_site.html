	<p> Hello, my name is Bryan Ulises Diaz and I am 23 years old. I currently attend the Universtity of Houston-Downtown. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have yet to decide in what area of the field to speciallize in but I am very much interestin in Web Programming and learning the skills to become a full stack developer. I have a cousin who is currently a full stack developer working at San Francisco working for Google. He is currently making a good living and I have someone to go to for advise in the field. Aside from coding I have various other hobbies. I love to play music at my local church. I know the basics to playing the piano, acoustic guitar and the bass. I currently work for my church as a media manager. It encompanses responsibilities of a social media manager and IT manager. Because the establishment is small I take charge of multiple roles. Something interesting about me is that I took a year and half of break after I graduated High School to live abroud in another country. I lived some time in Quilmes, Buenos Aires in Argentina. My favorite thing about my stay in Argentina is their cuisine. As a meat lover myself, I loved their BBQ's. </p>
